# Material for [PyCon DE & PyData 2025](https://2025.pycon.de/)

In occasion of the [Talk "Data as (Python) Code"], presented by
[Francesco Calcavecchia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescocalcavecchia/), the material in this folder gives the
opportunity to the audience to try out by themselves the examples showed during the presentation.

Most examples contain a `demo.sh` which was used by Francesco to obtain the outputs shown during the talk. It can be
executed with the command `zsh demo.sh`.

To run the examples you will need:

- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), used to install the python versions
  specified in the `.python-version` files.
